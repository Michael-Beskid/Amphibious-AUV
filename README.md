## Overview

The goal of this project is to design and test an amhibious quadrotor UAV that is capable of both aerial and underwater flight. The quadrotor is tasked with completing a fully autonomous mission to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Project Team

This project is a Major Qualifying Project (MQP) for partial fulfillment of undergraduate degree requirements at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

The project team is comprised of six students: Michael Beskid, Ryan Brunelle, Calsita Carrignan, Robert Devlin, Toshak Patel, & Kofi Sarfo.

## Acknowledgments

The project is advised by Professor Michael Demetriou (Aerospace Engineering Department) and Professor Loris Fichera (Robotics Engineering Department).

The flight control code is derived from dRehmFlight VTOL developed by Nicholas Rehm. Special thank you to Nick for his excellent work and willingness to share his work publicly to support projects like this one.
